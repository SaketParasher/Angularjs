/***********************************************       DIRECTIVES       ******************************************/

1) ng-src       ---> It delays the requesting of image until angular has a chance to replace ng-src text with the actual url of the image.
2) ng-change    ---> It executes each time input field value is changed but ng-model must be present on that input field.
3) ng-bind      ---> used as an alernative to expression binding ie. we can use ng-bind="event.name" instead of {{event.name}}
4) ng-bind-html ---> used to populate content of an element ie. a tag <> with the value of a variable .
                     ie. ng-bind-html="snippet" . html content of this tag will be replaced by html value of snippet variable.
5) ng-cloak     ---> hide a portion or all page until angular resolves all the bindings and expressions otherwise we will get a flash of bindings.
6) ng-style     ---> ng-style='varName' and varName is attached to scope in controller which contains css like object.
7) ng-class     ---> ng-class="className" . add the style on className in css file.

8) ng-disabled  ---> ng-disabled="value" element will be disabled or enabled based on the value which comes from controller.
9) ng-submit    ---> ng-submit="function()" will call the function() when the form is submitted.
10) ngNonBindable--> will not bind the expression and will print the same expression as it is.

** Never update DOM from controller do it by using directives.
